(Dashboard slide)
We created an interactive dashboard to visualize gun violence incidents across different states. 
Users can select a state from a dropdown menu, and the dashboard will dynamically generate three 
bar plots: one showing the number of incidents by year, another by day of the week, and the third 
by month. These visualizations help identify temporal patterns in gun violence for the selected state, 
making it easier to understand trends and potential correlations with time factors such as seasons or 
weekdays.

(Potential Usage slide)
Research into monthly and daily patterns of gun violence shows that incidents tend to spike during 
summer months and weekends. This aligns with psychological theories, such as the "heat hypothesis," 
which links high temperatures to increased aggression, and the impact of social gatherings and substance 
use on impulsive behavior. Weekends also see more violence due to stress release and risky behavior. 
Understanding these trends helps design interventions like conflict resolution programs in the summer and 
stricter alcohol regulations on weekends to reduce violence.
